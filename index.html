                                        This is includes, but is not limited to, Tattoos, Genesis Doll inventory for Character Appearance Customization, Land plot access, Estate Plot Access.

                                        In the Pocket Towne game itself, your land plot will be available for customization. Each tier of Land or Estate plot will have a set amount of default assets you can place anywhere on your plot.

                                        There will be template houses as well, that you can place on your plot so that you can decorate inside and around it using assets gained within the game, from your wallet or any combination.

                                        Example: Inside your house, you may want to put a picture frame on the wall, and showcase a Genesis Doll image as the photo in the frame. This can be any asset that we have validated on the wallet that you currently own.

                                        Because each projects metadata is different, they have to be added individually and manually to the system so it knows where the values it needs to generate the fighters Attack and Hit Points are located within the metadata structure.

                                        After the details have been fleshed out, we will do some testing on a testing server to verify that the numbers add up, and everything works correctly. Then when we are satisfied we will add the Brawl Bot to your project's Discord.

                                        Join our Pocket Towne discord, and contact Kardall (Kardall#4142) to discuss the process of integrating your project into the Brawl Bot.

                                        When you link your Discord ID using the command in the Pocket Towne Discord Server, it allows any of the services that we use on Discord to access the details of your wallet assets.

                                        The Pocket Towne Bot adjusts your roles automatically in our server, according to the wallet you have linked to your discord.

                                        The Brawl Bot RPG which can be on multiple project's servers, allows all projects to compete head to head in battle royale's and showcasing the winner and loser's chosen Assets at the end.

     'Fractallily grew up eating mac n cheese from the box and has either drawn by hand or created various forms of textile art since childhood. Somehow that cheesy pasta remained her favorite food even while she built a successful career in manufacturing. Even though she still consistently created works of art, it wasnt a primary source of income. When we were creating the concept for our paper doll CNFTs, it became known that Fractallily loved creating paper dolls as a child. This discovery led to the negotiations for her largest-to-date commissioned work of art, the Pocket Towne Genesis Paper Dolls.',
